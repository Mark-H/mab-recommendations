Convert the RTFM (Docs) to MarkDown
################

I propose changing the documentation to a markdown system and hosting the repository on github.

## Goal of Recommendation

The current docs have only a few editors, and are constantly falling out of date.  Converting to a MarkDown system would allow more community members to keep them up-to-date.

## Recommendation

Currently the RTFM is a pain to manage, and is falling out of date.  It is also hard, as an editor, to know when a page was last updated until you are actually on that page. 

I propose converting the documenation system to Daux.io, or something similar, to make it easier for third party developers to integrate documenation, as well as allowing the community to take part in furthering the documentation. Additionally, it would allow people to see change history of a specific document if they are on a different version.
