Assigning reference numbers to accepted recommendations
################

To more clearly refer to accepted recommendations, the (Vice-)Chair of the MAB is to assign a unique, incremental number to each accepted recommendation after a vote.

## Goal of Recommendation

To allow canonical references to a specific (accepted) recommendation via a unique number.

## Relevant Recommendations

N/a.

## Recommendation

The following reference numbering system is to be used. 

1. When a recommendation is accepted, the (Vice-)Chair is responsible for assigning a unique number to the recommendation. 
2. The reference numbers are added to the recommendation title, and prefixed to the filename/URL. 
3. The reference numbers are incremental. If the previous accepted recommendation was assigned the number 14, then the next will be 15. Draft recommendations or rejected recommendations do not affect the number.
4. Numbers below 10 will be prefixed with a zero. 
5. If multiple recommendations are accepted at the same time, the order is at the (Vice-)Chair's discretion. 

It is recommended that references to recommendations, for example in the "Relevant Recommendations" section of recommendations, are in the format `MAB-01 (Title Of Recommendation)`. Where possible, these should be linked to the recommendation text on GitHub or another official mirror.

When accepted, the numbering system is also to be applied to all previously accepted recommendations.
